This is one of my memos about PHP language.

**Memos** are used for recording the problems I encountered during programming and its solutions. I also write down something that is hard to remember for myself.

<!--shoreline-->

{% include toc %}

## Basic

### Array

``` php
# Random get $num of entities from $array
array_rand($array, $num);
```

### Long long string

[Heredoc](http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.heredoc)

``` php
$name = Silver;
echo <<<EOT
Hello, {$name}!
EOT;
/* Hello, Silver! */
```

[Nowdoc](http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.syntax.nowdoc)

``` php
$name = Silver;
echo <<<EOT
Hello, {$name}!
EOT;
/* Hello, {$name}! */
```

### Pass by reference

[Passing by Reference](http://php.net/manual/en/language.references.pass.php)

``` php
foreach ($array as &$item) {
    // Do something to $item here will change $array too
}

function foo(&$var)
{
    $var++;
}
$a=5;
foo($a);
// $a is 6 here
```

### Error processing

``` php
// Traceback of errors
debug_print_backtrace();
```

## Database

### mysqli

[MySQL Improved Extension](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php)

```php
/*
* MySQL Query using mysqli
* http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php
*/
<?php
include 'vendor/autoload.php';

$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "", "example");

/* check connection */
if ($mysqli->connect_errno) {
    printf("Connect failed: %s\n", $mysqli->connect_error);
    exit();
}

/* Select queries return a resultset */
if ($result = $mysqli->query("SELECT * FROM contacts LIMIT 10")) {
    printf("Select returned %d rows.\n", $result->num_rows);
    while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
        $person = array(
            'name' => $row['name'],
            'email' => $row['email']
        );
        $persons[] = $person;
    }
    /* free result set */
    $result->close();
}

d($persons);

$mysqli->close();
?>
```

## IO

### Script arguments

- [`$argv`](http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.argv.php) — Array of arguments passed to script
- [`getopt`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.getopt.php) — Gets options from the command line argument list

## Composer

### Custom composer package

Reference:
- [Creating your very own Composer Package](https://knpuniversity.com/screencast/question-answer-day/create-composer-package)
- [The composer.json Schema](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#json-schema)

The complete process is showing below.

#### Short list

1. Make your library git available.
1. Create a composer.json in the root of your library and fill it
1. Done, now we can require it in our project

#### Detail

**Package Setup:**

Suppose you already have a library, like this:

``` sh
└── src
    └── haha
        └── Hello.php
```

You need to create a composer.json:

``` sh
├── README.md
├── composer.json
└── src
    └── haha
        └── Hello.php
```

The `composer.json` should have these things at least:

- `name` - Define the name of this package. The whole repository will be cloned into `/vendor/{name}/`
- `autoload` - Define the autoload method to autoload your library when some project use it.
  - `autoload` have multiple ways to define, see this [autoload document](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload) for detail.
  - if your package already have autoload.php itself, just use `"files": [ "path/to/autoload.php" ]`
- You can also define your dependency with a `"require"` key.

```json
{
    "name": "silverhugh/toy",
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "happy\\": "src/"
        }
    }
}
```

And your package is ready!

**Project Setup:**

You can start from an empty project without any files. And then, create a `composer.json` in this empty playground.

Fill it just like this one:

- `repositories` - Make composer to know where to find your package if your package can't be found in [packagist](https://packagist.org/)
- `silverhugh/toy` - This must exactly the same name of the library defined in the composer.json
- `dev-master` - If you want exactly the latest code of this git repository
- `psy-psysh` - This php cli is just awesome

``` json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/example/example.git"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "silverhugh/toy": "dev-master",
        "psy/psysh": "0.8.11"
    }
}
```

Just `composer update`!

If you haven't got a `composer`, see the [installation guide of composer](http://localhost:4000/memo/boat/memo-laravel/#install-composer)

Now all things has been setup. The problem comes to how to use this custom package.

 I will choose two ways of using the class of package. The difference is just the different way you `autoload` your library.

Suppose the `Hello.php` contains these code:

``` php
<?php

namespace happy\haha;

class BigHello
{
    public static function Hello()
    {
        return "Awesome! You just make composer works.";
    }
}
```

Execute this code in the shell under the root of your project, and it just works!

``` php
vendor/bin/psysh
Psy Shell v0.8.11 (PHP 7.1.8 — cli) by Justin Hileman
>>> happy\haha\BigHello::Hello();
=> "Awesome! You just make composer works."
>>>
```
