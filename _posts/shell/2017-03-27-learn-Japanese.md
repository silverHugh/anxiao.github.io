Start to learn [Japanese language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language) this term (2016~2017 Spring). Japanese is sweet-sounding and we Chinese of my generation watch Japanese and read manga since childhood. So Japanese language is very dear to us.

Although Japanese is similar to Chinese, it's hard to learn for me. Remebering [Kana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana) is a painful process and it's just the beginning of Japanese learning!
