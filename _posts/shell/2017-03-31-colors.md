Colors has been a problem to me for a long time. Until these days I found some good materials about color theory makes me clear about it.

From the very beginning, I started to learn how to build a nice website. And I realized that which troubled me most was not HTML or JavaScript, it's CSS. Why? It's hard for a beginner to imagine a lookable style. I knew nothing about shape, typography, color and didn't know when to use shadow or what is a loyout. In brief, I didn't know anything related with design.

After years' obervation, learning and practice, I felt changed by design gradually. And the deeper I learn design, the more attractive design is for me. And when thinking comes to what is beauty, that's something about [Aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics). This is another question. Learning design makes me see more from everyday's life like a good badmiton player can get more details from a professional badmiton match than others.

Colors confused me for couple of years. At first I just tried to use them one by one. They often didn't make any sense and wasted me lots of time. With time goes by, I seemed to get some experience about color matching which I doubt. Sometimes I can make serveral colors harmonnious but I just think it's lucky. So there's strong voice in my brain that ask me to learn colors. But it's hard to find a good course about color. Until today.

From [Mr. Han](http://hanshilin.com/about/)'s website, there is [a video about colors](http://hanshilin.com/software/photoshop/photoshop-2/). That's just what I want all the time. Bravo! This video will tell you why we **see** a colorful world which seems very normal to us and what is tricolor and so on. The demonstration of complementary color is impressive. Hope you can get a lot from it too! I'm sorry that the video's language is Chinese and I haven't know where to find a great English one. But there is a great [Graphic Design Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/graphic-design) in Coursera. I learnt fundamental course and part of typo. Maybe they are helpful too.
