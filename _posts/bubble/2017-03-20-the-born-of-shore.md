Anxiao's HomePage [Shore](/) was born just now (2017-03-20 00:17:47).

Some explanations about my blog:
- **bubble**: contains something about __time__
- **boat**: contains something about __technology__
- **shell**: could be __anything interesting__
- **岸晓**: Chinese characters. "岸" means shore. "晓" means dawn. Just like a pen name for me or something what. The [icon](/anxiao.png) of my blog is [zhuanshu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_script) of "岸晓". Of course you should read it from right to left.
